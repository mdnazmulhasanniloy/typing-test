                              <strong> Local Storage:</strong> Local storage is useful for storing data that the user will need to access later, such as offline data. It allows 10MB of data to be stored. The stored data is not deleted when the browser is closed.<br><br>
                              <strong>Session Storage: </strong> Session storage is a great way to improve the performance of your web applications. It allows 5MB of data to be stored. The data is stored only for the session and will be deleted when the browser is closed.

                                <strong> Global Scope:</strong> The variables defined outside of any function or curly brackets are known as global variables and have global scope. Global scope means that the variables can be accessed from any part of that program, any function or conditional state can access that variable.<br><br>
                                <strong>Block Scope: </strong> Block scope is also a sub-type of local scope. The block scope can be defined as the scope of the variables inside the curly brackets {}. Now, these curly brackets can be of loops, or conditional statements, or something else. You are only allowed to refer to these variables from within the curly brackets {}.

                                <p> JavaScript has a runtime model based on an event loop, which is responsible for executing the code, collecting and processing events, and executing queued sub-tasks. This model is quite different from models in other languages like C and Java. </p>
                                The event loop got its name because of how it's usually implemented, which usually resembles:
                                <pre style="color: red;">while (queue.waitForMessage()) {queue.processNextMessage();}</pre>
                                queue.waitForMessage() waits synchronously for a message to arrive (if one is not already available and waiting to be handled).

                                <p> undefined is a property of the global object. That is, it is a variable in global scope. The initial value of undefined is the primitive value undefined.</p>
                                Also, when you try accessing values in, for example, an array or object that doesn’t exist, it will throw undefined.
                                We can also use the type of the variable to check if it’s undefined. Luckily for us undefined is a datatype for an undefined value as you can see below ‌                                queue.waitForMessage() waits synchronously for a message to arrive (if one is not already available and waiting to be handled).
